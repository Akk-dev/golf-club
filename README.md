# The Woods Golf Club reception desk

Simple golf club data management project using Python and MySQL 




## **About**
  *This project runs on python, with SQL connectivity. The reason I chose Python is because of it’s user-friendly interface and because it supports various databases like MySQL.*






## **Topic At Hand**
  *In this project, I have tried to emulate what a traditional Golf Course Management system looks and feels like. I imagined a premium, hip Golf Course in “THE WOODS” which has already established itself at the national scale.*
